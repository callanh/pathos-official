EntityDescription,A medium-sized creature prone to great ambition. Short-lived but ubiquitous; they are not to be underestimated.,
EntityDescription,"Amorphous beings who have no typical shape but often take on a translucent humanoid form. While unmistakable for anything other than a plasma-like ooze, this form enables the use of clothing and tools.",
EntityDescription,"An ancient race of towering recluses. Their terrifying size gives them immense strength, supplemented by a voracious diet of meats and minerals.",
EntityDescription,"Astral beings who are a vessel for the indomitable spirit of a vanquished adventurer. Having no motivations of their own, they are glad to permit the possession; for the deceased adventurer, it is a second chance at revenge or redemption. Born from astral matter, they are slightly built, translucent and can move freely through physical obstacles.",
EntityDescription,"Beautiful, otherworldly beings characterised by their signature halo and feathered wings. Strongly attuned to the struggle between good and evil, they sense the divinity within anything they hold.",
EntityDescription,Beware this clockwork machine of war.,
EntityDescription,"Fey creatures linked by powerful nature spirits to fuel their antics. They are stocky with furry lower bodies, cloven hooves of a goat and curled horns of a ram. Ribald and clever, they cheerfully lead hedonistic escapades of drinking, dancing and fighting.",
EntityDescription,"Large, carnivorous reptilians whose bestial ancestors dominated the world long before the birth of civilisation. They are fearsome predators, capable of leaping impressive distances and warding off many attacks with their thick scaly hides.",
EntityDescription,"Perverse creatures of many aberrations but always with crimson skin and horns. Their mere presence compels others to act out their darkest, most violent desires.",
EntityDescription,"Ravenous, predatory species of monstrous humanoid with a severe hunch that causes the backs of their hands to drag on the ground. Despite the awkward physical appearance, they are powerfully built and are infamous for their ability to rapidly recover from any wound to their rubbery hide.",
EntityDescription,"Shape-shifting deviants, who thrive on their deceptive talents.",
EntityDescription,"Small folk who prefer simple lives. They are notably gregarious, and their build lends them well to less-than-noble endeavours.",
EntityDescription,"Spiritual beings fond of nature and magic. They are physically similar to humans, but often smaller and nimbler.",
EntityDescription,"Stout, short, and hardy folk. They are known for their stubbornness, metalworking, and love of alcohol.",
EntityDescription,"Subterranean peoples of diminutive stature, fond of tinkering and magic. Evolved for subsistence living, their metabolism is suited for long adventures where food is scarce.",
EntityDescription,"The lesser of the two ferrozygotic puddings, the brown pudding is said to taste more akin to rotted milk than a chocolate dessert. The pudding itself feeds upon fabrics and hides of all kind but its most known ability is its unique reproductive method. When brought into contact with iron the miracle of rotten slime binary fission takes place, creating two voracious offspring. Owing to the ubiquity of iron in the arms wielded by adventurers, this creature's population has only been growing with time.",
EntityDescription,"This mummy confection was created by steeping a human cadaver in honey. Somehow reanimated by an obscure cult of monks, it is both deadly and delicious.",
EntityDescription,This strange living bubble of corrosive fluids doesn't appear to have any offensive capabilities.,
EntityDescription,"Tiny winged spirits, inherently magical and extraordinarily beautiful. When threatened, they can escape through distortions in spatial reality.",
EntityDescription,"Tortoise-like nomadic survivalists who leave their birthplace, from the moment they can walk, to travel the world with the comfort and protection of home on their backs.",
EntityDescription,"Ugly, brutish creatures with cannibalistic tendencies; this warlike race is known for their impressive strength and intellectual incapabilities.",
EntityDescription,"Unfairly characterised as cowardly and weak, these diminutive reptilian creatures overcome their physical limitations by employing vicious and cunning strategies.",

PropertyDescription,A shimmering magical shield surrounds your body which aids in your defence and has a chance to deflect incoming missiles.,
PropertyDescription,"Coated in a slick and oily resin, you simply slide out of grasp and maw.",
PropertyDescription,Control when and where you teleport.,
PropertyDescription,Deranged with anger you lash out at friend and foe alike without thought or reason.,
PropertyDescription,Enhances your vision so you can see otherwise invisible creatures.,
PropertyDescription,Fainting from lack of food.,
PropertyDescription,Fly above the ground to avoid many types of traps.,
PropertyDescription,Fumbling causes you to drop your weapon during combat and fall up and down the stairs.,
PropertyDescription,Gaze and beam attacks are reflected back at the caster.,
PropertyDescription,Gives you advance warning of nearby monsters and their approximate threat level.,
PropertyDescription,Gripped by terror you cannot attack and should flee.,
PropertyDescription,"In this heady state of intoxication, your wildly increased confidence is only offset by your badly impaired judgement.",
PropertyDescription,Moving quietly through the dungeon you can sneak up on sleeping monsters.,
PropertyDescription,Prevents you being polymorphed but also prevents you turning back into your natural form.,
PropertyDescription,"Protects you from effects that slow, paralyse or otherwise restrain your movement.",
PropertyDescription,Recover mana at an increased rate.,
PropertyDescription,Revives you to half-health when you die at the cost of one point of constitution.,
PropertyDescription,Suddenly you will fall asleep until you wake or are woken.,
PropertyDescription,"Teleportation transports your character around the immediate dungeon level. When uncontrolled, this is a random event that adds a degree of unpredictability to your journey. Controlled teleportation allows you to select on the map your destination location.",
PropertyDescription,The guilt-free practice of eating the flesh and organs of beings from your own race.,
PropertyDescription,This allows you to detect the presence and location of minds but only when you cannot see.,
PropertyDescription,This causes your image to appear not quite where you are located. For sentient opponents this makes it more difficult for them to strike at you. Magical effects such as beams and strikes have a reduced chance to hit you.,
PropertyDescription,This enhancement to your speed allows you to move and attack more often.,
PropertyDescription,This impairment of vision means you can only see things in a very close proximity.,
PropertyDescription,This is in defiance to gravity and is useful to avoid many types of traps. If only you could reach the floor at the same time.,
PropertyDescription,This is the renewal of your body through rapid healing and regrowth. Your metabolism is greatly increased and you require more food than normal.,
PropertyDescription,This is the state of being unseen. You move with a slight distortion of light that is only noticeable when you are nearby.,
PropertyDescription,This profound hearing impairment has cut you off from the audible world.,
PropertyDescription,This reduction to your speed causes you to move and attack less often.,
PropertyDescription,This special vision allows you to see warm-bodied entities in the dark areas of the dungeon.,
PropertyDescription,"Transform into another entity with all the advantages or disadvantages that brings. For example, entities may not have hands but can fly and breathe deadly beams of energy. When you perish in your polymorphed form you will often revert to your original form.",
PropertyDescription,Using the power of your mind to move objects without physical interaction.,
PropertyDescription,Visual perception is distorted as your mind twists ordinary items and entities into absurd and nightmarish forms.,
PropertyDescription,When confused you will struggle to make decisions. You may move or attack in an unintended direction and you cannot cast spells.

PropertyDescription,"Your body is halfway between planes and this means you can pass effortlessly through walls, doors and boulders.",
PropertyDescription,Your legs feel like strong coils ready to spring into action and over great distances.,
PropertyDescription,Your mere presence aggravates everyone in the dungeon.,

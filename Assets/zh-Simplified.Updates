- Major change to the 'speed' mechanic. Previously, speed was the number of ticks to move a single square where there are 60 ticks in a second. Lower was faster, higher was slower. Speed has been redefined as number of squares per second (per 60 ticks). Now, lower is slower and higher is faster. Speed of 12 is now speed 5.0. Quickness increases your speed by 50% (speed 5.0 becomes 7.5). Slowlness decreases your speed by 50% (speed 5.0 becomes 2.5). Speed boots enchantment bonus is applied to the speed (speed boots +5 takes speed up to 10.0). If you polymorph into a fire vampire (base speed 10.0) and put on speed boots +5, you will have speed of 15.0 (which is the same a speed 4 in the old scheme). Petrifying reduces you to quarter speed.  This new scheme scales better at the really fast and really slow. It is also a more sensible better coordinate space - 4.0 speed means you move 4 squares per second rather than 15 speed being moving one square takes 15 ticks.
